output in console:

hello world
multiplication result 22637556228
call me asap
call me after 3s

reason:
since the code for setTimeoutzero is offloaded to libuv , then the callback function can only be executed by js engine's callstack only when the callstack is empty that is all synchronous code ( that is global execution context is out of callstack) has been executed , hence call me asap is printed after the multiplication result even if the time was 0 milliseconds
